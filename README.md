# Scheduler
A work day scheduler with color coded time blocks

A daily scheduler made with moments.js!

Date at the top of the page will update daily.

12 Time blocks in case you have a long day at work!

Each time block will change color based on the time.
If the time block is before the current time, it will be grey
If the time block is the current time, it will be red
If the time block is after the current time, it will be green.

Add events to each hour block!
Type inside the time block, and hit the save button to save the event!
The event will save inside Local Storage and be there when you refresh the page!  Yeay!
Simply hit the save button again with nothing in the time block to clear the event!

Enjoy!
